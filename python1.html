## What's an algorithm

* **Action**: an event that takes place in a finite period of time and produces
  an expected and well-defined result.

--

* **Information**: anything we can observe or find out about an action.

--

* **State**: the information available at a given time point.

--

* **Algorithm**: sequence of actions starting at an initial state and ending at
  an end state, in which we obtain the result.

## What's a program

* Building an algorithm consists of (1) discovering which elementary actions have
to occur and (2) how they should be organised throughout time, to obtain the result.

--

* Such an exercise requires:

  * Ability for abstract thought and procedural abstraction at different levels.
  * Using a language with precise syntax and notation.
  * Problem solving.

* Abstraction: focus attention on the main problem, ignoring
lower-level details.

* Procedural abstraction: understand what a procedure should do
without knowing exactly it how does it.

--

* Writing a program is implementating an algorithm in a
specific programming language.

## Literals, constants and variables


* [Literal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_%28computer_programming%29):
value that does not change over time, e.g.:
```
3.1416, 1, 2, 3, "Hello World!", ...
```

* [Constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_%28computer_programming%29):
named literal, a value that does not change over time but which we refer to it by a given name, typically written in upper case letters, e.g.:
```
PI, A, B, C, ...
```

* [Variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_%28computer_science%29):
named container storing a value, which may change over time, e.g.:
```
x, y, z, i, j, k, ...
```

* Constant and variable names should consist of letters and/or digits, but
they should not start with a digit. Underscores are allowed. E.g.:
```
x1, y1, A4, result2, sum_of_squares, ...
```

---

## Assignments

* [Assignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_%28computer_science%29):
statement that sets the value of a variable using an operator, typically `=`, for
instance:

```
x = 1
x = 2
```

* In an assignment, the left-hand side of the assignment operator is always a
variable, while the right-hand side is what we want to assign into the variable.

---

## Expressions

* [Expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_%28computer_science%29):
syntactically correct specification of one or more operations over any given set
of literals, constants, variables or functions. E.g.:

```
1 + 1
x + 2
y / 2
```

* The right-hand side of an assignment can be an expression:

```
x = x + 1
y = ( log(100) - x ) / 3
```

* Arithmetic operators

|   Operator          |  Example  |  Result|
|-------------------- | --------- | -------|
|   addition          |   2 + 2   |    4   |
| subtraction         |   3 - 2   |    1   |
|multiplication       |   3 * 2   |    6   |
|division (quotient)  |   6 / 3   |    2   |
|division (remainder) |   6 % 4   |    2   |

## Control flow

* When we run an algorithm, there is a flow of actions being executed after
one another.

* The course of the flow of execution depends on the so-called
[control flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow) statements.

* There are three main types of control flow statements:

  * Sequential: actions are executed in a particular order.

  * Conditional: one or more actions are executed only under a specific condition.

  * Iterative: one or more actions are executed multiple times until a specific condition is met.

* In the next slides we will be using Python syntax to illustrate these
  control flow statements.

---

## Control flow

* Comparison operators: operators that compare two values and return a truth value,
either `true` or `false`.

|    Description        |  Operator |
|---------------------- | --------- |
|     equality          |    ==     |
|    inequality         |    !=     |
|    greater than       |    >      |
|    smaller than       |    <      |
| greater or equal than |    >=     |
| smaller or equal than |    <=     |

* `2 > 1` is `true`.

* `2 < 1` is `false`.

* `x > 0` will be `true` or `false` depending on the actual value of `x`.
---

## Control flow

* Sequential control flow:

```
a = 2
b = a
b = b + a * 4
print(b)
```

* The `print(b)` instruction will print the value of `b` in the terminal window.
Think about what value is going to print in the previous code and in each of the
two code blocks below.

```
a = 2
b = a
print(b)
b = b + a * 4
```

```
a = 2
print(b)
b = a
b = b + a * 4
```

---

## Control flow

* Conditional control flow, also known as an "if statement":

  <pre>
  a = 4
  b = 7
  c = (a * b) + 1

  if a % 2 == 0:
    print("even")
  else:
    print("odd")
  </pre>

* What is going to print on the terminal window the previous code block, "even" or "odd"?

---

## Control flow

* Iterative control flow, also known as a "while statement" or "loop":

  <pre>
  i = 0
  s = 0
  while i < 10:
    i = i + 1
    s = s + i

  print(s)
  <pre>

* What is it doing the previous code block with respect to the variable `s`?

---

## Control flow

* How to figure out an iterative control flow from scratch:

  <pre>
  i = 0  ## initial condition: should happen before looping
  s = 0  ## initial condition: should happen before looping
  while i < 10: ## final condition: should not happen when looping
    i = i + 1   ## invariant condition: always happens when looping
    s = s + i   ## invariant condition: always happens when looping

  print(s)
  <pre>

---

## Problem solving

* Write a program in Python that sums the first 10 natural numbers.

---

## Concluding remarks

* Spaces and newlines are important in Python to define control flow statements.

* Problem solving is key to learn programming.
